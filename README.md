# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning. It explores various customer features, such as demographics, services subscribed, and billing information, to identify key factors influencing churn. 

## Project Highlights:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of customer data to understand churn patterns and identify relevant features.
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new features for better model performance.
* **Visualization:** Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize churn trends and relationships between variables.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn.
* **Insights and Recommendations:** Identifying key factors driving customer churn and providing actionable recommendations to reduce churn rates.
